SkySense aims to be more than a traditional weather app by integrating health-aware forecasting. In many regions, air quality, dust particles, humidity, and extreme weather directly affect peopleâ€™s health and lifestyle. Traditional apps often show raw data without translating it into personalized, actionable recommendations.
